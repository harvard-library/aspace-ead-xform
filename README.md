# aspace_ead_xform
Transform an EAD via XSLT in various ways

Using a generated EAD, apply XSLT transforms to it.

Initially: create a "staff side" CSV for a Resource [Collection]

This plugin will begin life on the ArchivesSpace `/frontend`; subsequent use of the core transform class may need to be duplicated on the `/public` side as well.
